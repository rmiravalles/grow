# 👋 Welcome to My Kubernetes Learning Portfolio

Here I'll document my journey through the [KubeSkills GROW program](https://kubeskills.com/grow/) (GitHub Repository of Work). You'll find my notes, reflections, and hands-on exercises, as well as the [Daily Kubeskills challenges](https://daily.kubeskills.com/).

I'll do my best to be as consistent as possible.

Each section of this site contains:

- ✅ Hands-on labs with YAML and `kubectl`
- 🧠 Weekly reflections on what I’ve learned
- 🔐 Security-focused best practices
- 🚀 GitOps workflows and cluster automation
