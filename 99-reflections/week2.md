# Week 2 Reflection – GitOps with FluxCD

This week, I set up GitOps in my cluster using **FluxCD**. I bootstrapped my own repository, created a Git source and a Kustomization, and learned how declarative workflows can automate and standardize Kubernetes operations.

## ✅ What I Learned

### What is GitOps?

GitOps is a deployment model that uses Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. Changes to the desired state are made in Git, and automated processes ensure that the actual state in the cluster matches the desired state.

### Core principles of GitOps

1. Declarative Descriptions
2. Versioned and Immutable Storage
3. Automated Delivery

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

I’m curious to explore how GitOps handles secrets, multi-cluster environments, and policy-based validations using tools like SOPS, Kyverno, or Vault.
