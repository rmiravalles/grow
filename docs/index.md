# ✅ Week 1: Kubernetes Fundamentals

This week, I worked through the Kubernetes fundamentals lab where I deployed a basic NGINX web server using both a Pod and a Deployment. I also learned about security contexts and how to scale workloads. You can read my detailed reflection on Week 1 [here](99-reflections/week1.md).

# ✅ Week 2: GitOps with FluxCD

I still need to finish the tasks for this week I started setting up FluxCD to automate the deployment of my applications from a Git repository, but I sill need to finish the process. I took a few notes, though, and you can find them [here](99-reflections/week2.md).

# ✅ Week 3: Security Best Practices

This week, I learned about Kubernetes security best practices. As for the previous week, I still need to dive deeper here. I want to add more content about the suggested security tools **Falco** and **Kyverno**. You can read more about it in my reflection [here](99-reflections/week3.md).
