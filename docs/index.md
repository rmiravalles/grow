# 👋 Welcome to My Kubernetes Learning Portfolio

Hello!

My name's Rodrigo, originally from Brazil, and living in Spain for the past 8 years. I'm a novice DevOps Engineer working with Azure infrastructure. I'm an everyday learner, with a passion for challenges and discoveries. My goal is to skill up in Kubernetes and obtain the CKA certification.

Here I'll document my journey through the [KubeSkills GROW program](https://kubeskills.com/grow/) (GitHub Repository of Work). You'll find my notes, reflections, and hands-on exercises, as well as the [Daily Kubeskills challenges](https://daily.kubeskills.com/).

I'll do my best to be as consistent as possible.

Under **Reflections** you'll find my weekly summaries, exercises, and insights, as defined in the GROW curriculum. Under **Daily Notes** you'll find my notes and solutions to the Daily Kubeskills challenges. Since there are many, I'll bundle them by week.

## Getting Started

For my Kubernetes learning environment, I chose to use [K3D](https://k3d.io/), instead of [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), the one suggested in the curriculum.
